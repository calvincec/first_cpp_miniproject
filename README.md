## Introduction

The **First C++ Mini Project** is designed to demonstrate proficiency in several key areas of programming, including data structures, algorithms, OOP principles, and basic C++ coding. This project provides a practical example of how these concepts can be applied to create a Student Grade Management System.

## Concepts Employed

The project employs the following concepts:

- Data Structures: Utilizes a doubly linked list data structure.
- Algorithms: Implements a sorting algorithm (bubble sort) for ranking students.
- Sorting Algorithm: Uses bubble sort for ranking students.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Demonstrates class concepts for student objects.
- Pointers: Utilizes pointers for managing linked list connections.

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a `Node` class representing a student.
2. Allows input of the surname, midname, and last name for 10 students.
3. Accepts marks for each student in 14 subjects.
4. Computes the total marks and grade for each student.
5. Ranks the students based on their average grades.
6. Implements a bubble sort algorithm to rank the students.
7. Utilizes a doubly linked list to manage the sequence of students.

## Features

- Interactive input for student details and marks.
- Automatic calculation of total marks and grades.
- Ranking of students based on their average grades using bubble sort.
- Implementation of a doubly linked list for student sequencing.
