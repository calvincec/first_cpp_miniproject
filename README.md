# first_cpp_miniproject
a code to display basic c++, oop, data structures and algorithms skills </br>

This code employs these concepts:
- Data structures (doubly linked list) and algorithms
- Sorting algorithm (bubble sort)
- C++ coding
- Class concept in OOP
- Pointers concept

The code:
- creates a node class that will be used to get 10 objects rep 10 students
- allows input of surname, midname and last name of 10 students
- inputs marks for each students in the 14 subjects
- computes the total marks and grade for each student
- ranks the students depending on their average grades
- ranks the student using bubble sort algorithm
- uses doubly linked list to get the next and prevous students
